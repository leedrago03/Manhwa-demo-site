# Manhwa Demo Website

## Overview
This project is a simple web application that displays a list of manhwa titles, their genres, and descriptions. The application is inspired by the article **"The Best Fantasy Manhwa You Must Read Now."** 

To ensure high availability and scalability, the application leverages **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** and **Load Balancers**:
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demands, ensuring that the application can handle varying loads while optimizing costs.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to enhance availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that no single instance is overwhelmed with requests.

The application showcases a responsive design and retrieves images from an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Features
- Display a list of manhwa titles with genres and images.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
- Utilizes Amazon S3 for image storage.
